<h1>Welcome to Pecker Picker</h1>
<p class="lead">
A pecker is a person or thing that pecks, as a bird does, taking bit by bit, as with a beak.

<p>
A picker is a special tool or machine for picking fruit or vegetables.

A Pecker Picker is a Web app that searches for one word in a sentence or paragraph of text and returns a value equal to the number of times the target word appears in the text.
